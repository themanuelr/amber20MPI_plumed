PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.bias 
PLUMED:  +++ WARNING +++ using TEMP=285 while MD engine uses 309.998
PLUMED:  +++ WARNING +++ the provided STATE_RFILE will be ignored, since RESTART was not requested
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.rct 
PLUMED:   added component to this action:  opes.zed

PLUMED:   temperature = 285
PLUMED:   beta = 1.76568
PLUMED:   depositing new kernels with PACE = 500
PLUMED:   expected BARRIER is 2
PLUMED:   using target distribution with BIASFACTOR gamma = 3.53137
PLUMED:   adaptive SIGMA will be used, with ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE = 5000
PLUMED:     thus the first x kernel depositions will be skipped, x = ADAPTIVE_SIGMA_STRIDE/PACE = 10
PLUMED:   kernels are truncated with KERNELS_CUTOFF = 2.65758
PLUMED:  +++ WARNING +++ probably kernels are truncated too much
PLUMED:   the value at cutoff is = 0.0292649
PLUMED:   regularization EPSILON = 0.247822
PLUMED:   kernels will be compressed when closer than COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 1
PLUMED:   state checkpoints are written on file compressed_Kernels.data every 50000 MD steps
PLUMED:   using multiple OpenMP threads per simulation: 8
